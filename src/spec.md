# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Build a customer ledger management application for tracking customer information and financial transactions with automatic balance calculations.

**Planned changes:**
- Create backend data models for customers (ID, name, email, phone, timestamp) and transactions (ID, customer reference, date, description, debit, credit, balance, timestamp)
- Implement CRUD operations for customers and transaction management functions with automatic balance calculation
- Build customer list interface displaying all customers with current balances and add/edit/delete actions
- Create transaction history view showing chronological ledger entries with debit, credit, and running balance columns
- Add forms for customer management with validation for name, email, and phone fields
- Add transaction form with date picker, description, transaction type selector (debit/credit), and amount input
- Apply warm earth tone color palette (terracotta, beige, olive green) with professional typography throughout the UI
- Include ledger icon in application header

**User-visible outcome:** Users can manage a list of customers, record debit and credit transactions for each customer, and view running balances and transaction history in a professional, warm-toned interface.
